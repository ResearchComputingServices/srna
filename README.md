<h1>Program to compute sRNAs for a given input genome in python<h1>

The algorithm to compute sRNAs is provided by Prof. Alex Wong at Carleton University. 

<h2>How to run the program in your local machine<h2>
  
<h3>Prerequisites<h3>

**Blast:**
1. If blast is not already installed, install blast in your local machine by following these instructions:

<h3> Run sRNA locally <h3>
  
 1. Donwload the latest release of the code.
 2. Go to the directory where the sRNA code is located.
 3. Create a virtual enviroment for python by typing: 
    *python3 -m venv env*
    or by following these instructions: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
 4. Activate your virtual enviroment by typing:
    *source ./env/bin/activate*
 5. The program to be run is *main.py* and the parameters that it receives are the following:
